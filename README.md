# Python_Project1_Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on product/brand comparison for E-commerce website.

### Aim : To perform Data Analysis/EDA process and Interpretate the result.

### Scope:
* Helps us to learn Web scrapping /Data analysis and Visualization. 
* Widens up with concept of EDA .
* Helps to understand Comparison of different products .
* To do real time analysis.

### Description:
Considering two brands of mobile from a website. Fetching the data by using web-scrapping method. EDA/Analysing and Interpretating the results.

### Objective: To analyse the best brand according to the data according to different parameters like Price/Rating/Discount/Storage/Color.

##### Website : FLIPKART
##### Libraries Used : BeautifulSoup/ Urlopen/ Pandas/ Numpy/ Matplotlib/ Seaborn

### Process of Data Analysis:
* Data Collection 
* Data Cleansing
* Finding Missing data
* Error analysis
* Data Transformation
* Data Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Inferential Statistics

##### Data Collection :
Collecting the data through web-scrapping from flipkart website. Data collected of two brands( Realme & Samsung).

##### Data Cleaning :
Cleaning the data. As the web-scrapped data consists extra/ misleading values, it needs to be cleaned properly so as to create a appropriate dataframe.

##### Finding Missing Data :
Analysing the missing data values and filling it with appropriate value.

##### Error Analysis :
Analysis the error in the data like data types/ data structure etc.

##### Data Transformation :
The process where we transform our data into the required format. Changing the structure of data mapping to different parameters or converting to other data format.

##### Data Wrangling :
Converting the messy and complex data into easy format.

##### Data Visualization :
The process of translating large data sets and metrics into charts, graphs and other visuals. Visualization is much more easier to understand compared to that of descriptive study. We can compare our data on different parameters using suitable graphs and present the result.

##### Inferential Statistics :
It takes data from sample and make generalizations about a population. It hepls to analysis if the dataset is very large. Hypothesis testing and estimation works in this process.

#### According to the project process considered as follows:
* Creating Brand1 Dataset ( Realme Data Set)
* Creating Brand2 Dataset ( Realme Data Set)
* Analysisng and Adding Required Column Manually
* Merging both the dataset
* Analysing the data (Null,Missing,Zero values)
* Visualizaing the data
* Interpreting the result
* Conclusion
